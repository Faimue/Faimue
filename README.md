# Hello, I'm Faimue ðŸ‘‹

## About Me 

I'm Faimue, a new developer, trying to make the best apps possible. I'm always eager to learn more, and already know a handful of languages, such as python, C#, rust and java script. 

I'm fairly new to github and app development all together, but I'm working hard to make sure that I can improve as much as I can. 

## Work With Me

I am looking for people who are willing to work with me, and help me in the process of creating apps and monitoring my repos. Anyone interested, let my know by mentioning me in any of my discussion tabs in any and all public repositories. 

### Server Info

I currently have my own online server up and running, so all my apps will be on there. Anyone interested in helping to maintaining these servers, let me know 

# Enjoy
